<chorus><![CDATA['Tis this pub that we call home
And from her we oft times may roam
But our respite we'll find in a pint maybe nine
in this pub that we call home]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Well allow me to tell ye of a place dear to heart
Of each sailor and solier both slobbin and smart
Each space in that place is familiar and warm
Where each traveler weary retreats from life's storm]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Though married but not merry bearing lowly life's load
And suffering the chafing my long wedding road
Entombed in the womb of this three house and bath 
Her walls provide shelter from my wife's wicked wrath]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[In the hours when life sours and I'm weary and beat
To the hawking and talking I need to retreat
With a pale cup of ale and my good mate's concerns
I'm rested yet bleary to the battle return]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[With a raging of aging in my last breath I crave
Please pull up the floorboards and dig me a grave
As you rouse and perouse pour an ale on the floor
If you listen with care you may hear me cry "more!"]]></verse>
