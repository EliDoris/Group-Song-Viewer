<chorus><![CDATA[She wore no jewels, no costly diamond
No paint or powder, oh no, none at all.
She wore a bonnet with ribbons on it
And round her shoulder was a Galway Shawl.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Near Orenmore in the County Galway,
One pleasant evening in the month of May,
I spied a damsel, she was fair and handsome
And her beauty fairly took my breath away.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[She kept on walking, and she kept on talking,
'Till her father's cottage, it came into view.
Said she: “Come in, sir, and meet my father,
And play to please him The Foggy Dew.”]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I played The Blackbird, The Stack of Barley,
Rodney's Glory and The Foggy Dew,
She sang each note like an Irish linnet.
Her tears came into her eyes of blue.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA['Twas early, early, all in the morning,
I took the road for old Donegal.
She sighed and kissed me, then she said “Goodbye Sir”
But my heart remains with that Galway shawl.]]></verse>
