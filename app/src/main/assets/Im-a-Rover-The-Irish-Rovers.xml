<chorus><![CDATA[I'm a rover, seldom sober
I'm a rover of high degree
Ans when I'm drinking, I'm always thinking
How to gain my love's company]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Though the night be dark as dungeon, not a star to be seen above
I will be guided without a stumble, into the arms of me only love
I went up to her bedroom window, kneeling gently upon a stone
I rapped on her bedroom window 
My darling dear, do you lie alone?]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[She raised her head up from her feather pillow
Raised her arms up around her breast
Saying who's at me bedroom window, disturbing me at me long night's rest?
It's only me, your own true lover, open the door and please let me in
For I have come on a long night's journey
I am near drenched to the skin]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[She opened the door with the greatest pleasure
Opened the door and she let me in
We both shook hands and embraced each other
'Til the morning we lay as one]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well now me love, I must go and leave you
Though the mountains be high above
Well, I will climb them with greater pleasure 
That I have been with me only love]]></verse>
