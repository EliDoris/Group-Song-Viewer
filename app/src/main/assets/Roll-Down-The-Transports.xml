<chorus><![CDATA[And we'll roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down,
Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Ye ladies of Ply-mouth, we bid you good-bye,
Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!
We will rock you and roll you again by and by,
Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The anchor's away and the sails are unfurled,
Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!
We're bound for to sail her halfway 'round the world,
Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[In the deep Bay of Biscay the seas do run high,
Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!
Them poor weary transports they'll wish they could die,
Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout,
Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!
Them poor weary transports, they'll goggle and shout,
Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down! ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When at last we draw near to Australia's bold strand,
Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!
Them poor weary transports, they'll long for the land,
Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Then, sweet ladies of Plymouth, we'll pay all your rent,
Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!
And go roving no more till our money's all spent, 
Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!]]></verse>
