<chorus><![CDATA[Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Step it out, mary, if you can
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Show your legs to the countryman (x2)]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[In the village of Kilgory, there's a maiden young and fair
Her eyes shine like diamonds, she has long and golden hair
The horseman he comes riding, riding up to her father's gates
On a milk-white stallion, he comes at the strike of eight.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I have come to court your daughter, Mary of the golden hair
I have gold and I have silver, I have goods beyond compare
I will buy her silks and satin and a gold ring for her hand
She shall have a mansion, she'll have servants to command]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I don't want your gold and silver, I don't want your house and land
I am going with a soldier, I have promised him my hand
But the father spoke up sharply: You will do as i command,
You'll get married on a Sunday and you'll wear that wedding band]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[In the village of Kilgory there's a deep stream flowing by
On her wedding day at midnight she drowns with her soldier boy
In the cottage there is music, you can hear her father say:

Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter, Sunday is your wedding day.
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter]]></verse>
