<chorus><![CDATA[Let The Wind Blow High
Let The Wind Blow Low
Through The Streets In M'kilt I'll Go
All The Lassies Shout "Hello!"
"Donald Where's Your Troosers?"]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Well I've Just Come Down From The Isle Of Skye
I'm Not Very Big
And I'm Awfully Shy
The Lassies Shout As I Go By
"Donald Where's Your Troosers"]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[A Lassie Took Me To A Ball
And It Was Slippery In The Hall
I Was Afraid That I Might Fall
Twas'nae wearin' Troosers]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[To Wear The Kilt Is My Delight
I'm Never Wrong
'Cause I'm Always Right
The Highlanders Would Get A Fright
If They Saw My Wearing Troosers!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well I Was Driving In My Car
Went Downtown To Kenny's Bar
15 Scotches, Five Cigars
And I Left Without Me Troosers]]></verse>
