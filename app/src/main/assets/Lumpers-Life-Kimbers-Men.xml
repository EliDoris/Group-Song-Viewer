<chorus><![CDATA[And it's all the night and half a day
Sweating for your lumpers pay
Fill the boxes up and down, lumping's hard in grimsby Town]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[The fish are waiting in the hole
And nights have come to town
Folks with sense are in their beds but the lumpers they go down
Down pneumonia jetty where the wind cuts like a knife
I wish to christ I never started on the lumping life]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[We're called the midnight millionaires by folks who'll never know
How your hands go stiff incased in ice when the temperatures below
The wind cuts through your guts me lads your face is stiff and blue
And you wish the trawler rollers were down there instead of you]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Me father was a lumper and a dockman all his life
Me mother told me sister never be a lumper's wife
You'll wash his fishy overalls and darn his stiff old socks
And every night you'll sleep alone while he goes down the docks]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[If ever I win the pools me lads me lumping days are through
I'll cash me check from little woods and I know just what I'll do
I'll treat me mates and say goodbye and leave the lumping life
And then I'll go to bed at night and get to know me wife]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I'll burn me dirty clogs and throw me lumping card away
I'll put me leggings in the shed and leave them there to stay
I'll tell the lousy setter on to stop his midnight call
And turn me back forever on the bloody cold north wall]]></verse>
