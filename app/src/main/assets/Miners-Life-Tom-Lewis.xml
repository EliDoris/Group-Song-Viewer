<chorus><![CDATA[Union miners stand together, do not heed the owner's tale, 
Keep your hand upon your wages and your eye upon the scale.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Miner's life is like a sailor, aboard a ship to cross the waves, 
Every day his life's in danger, still he ventures, being brave, 
Watch the rocks they're falling daily, careless miners always fail, 
Keep your hand upon your wages and your eye upon the scale.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[You've been docked and docked again boy, you've been loading two for one, 
What have you to show for working since your mining has begun, 
Worn-out boots and worn-out miner, lungs of stone and children pale 
Keep your hand ....]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[In conclusion, bear in memory, keep the password in your mind, 
God provide for every worker when in union they combine. 
Stand like men and link together, victory for you shall prevail 
Keep your hand ....]]></verse>
