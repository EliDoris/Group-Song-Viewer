<chorus><![CDATA[Oh, come out ye' black and tans
Come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell her how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[I was born on a Dublin street where the Royal drums did beat
And those loving English feet they walked all over us
And every single night when me da' would come home tight
He'd invite the neighbours out with this chorus]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Come let us hear you tell
How you slandered great Parnell
When you fought them well and truly persecuted
Where are the smears and jeers
That you loudly let us hear
When our leaders of sixteen were executed]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Come tell us how you slew
Them old Arabs two by two
Like Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows
How bravely you faced each one
With your sixteen pounder gun
And you frightened them damn natives to their marrow]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The day is coming fast
And the time is here at last
When each yeoman will be cast aside before us
And if there be a need
Sure my kids wil sing, "Godspeed!"
With a verse or two of Steven Beehan's chorus]]></verse>
