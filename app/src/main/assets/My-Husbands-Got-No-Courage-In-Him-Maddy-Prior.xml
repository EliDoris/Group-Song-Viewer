<verse><![CDATA[As I walked out one May morning
To view the fields and the leaves a-springing
I saw two maidens standing by
And one of them her hands was wringing]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[All sort of vittles I did provide
All sorts of meats that's fitting for him
With oyster pie and rhubarb too
But nothing will put courage in him]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[My husband can dance and caper and sing
And do anything that is fitting for him
But he cannot do the thing I want
Because he has no courage in him]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[My husband's admired wherever he goes
And everyone looks well upon him
With his handsome features and well-shaped leg
But still he's got no courage in him]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Every night when I goes to bed
I lie and throw my leg right o'er him
And my hand I clap between his thighs
But I can't put any courage in him]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Seven long years I've made his bed
And every night I've lain beside him
And this morning I rose with my maidenhead
For still he's got no courage in him]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I wish my husband he was dead
And in the/his grave I'd quickly lay him
And then I'd try another one
That's got a little courage in him]]></verse>
