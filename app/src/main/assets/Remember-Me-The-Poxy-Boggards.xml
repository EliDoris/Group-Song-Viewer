<chorus><![CDATA[I remember her hair and her warm summer smile
I remember caressing so tender and mild
I remember the woman I left for the sea
and I pray to the heavens she'll remember me]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[I don't remember the night that I left
The night that I went off to sail the sea
That night of hard drinking it left me bereft
Of a good woman whose love was undying and would never cease]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[We sailed the seas for American gold
The captain was wise and the crew they were bold
A share for the crown and the rest for the crew
With all of these riches to gain, I'd trade them for one night with you]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[A fortnight from home from the crow's nest a bell
A fierce Spanish galleon who long left her load
Then from her broadside a black smokey hell
Around me the crew was in terror, we heard word the captain had fell]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I float in the sea in her soft salty foam
I futilely reckon the direction for home
Dreaming one day to reaching the shore
I'll swim like a madman to hold, that lass in my arms once more]]></verse>
