<chorus><![CDATA[I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Some bright morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When the shadows of this life have gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls I'll fly
I'll fly away]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh, how glad and happy when we meet
I'll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet
I'll fly away]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away]]></verse>
