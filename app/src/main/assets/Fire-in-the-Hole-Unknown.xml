<chorus><![CDATA[Stand up boys, let the bosses know.
Turn your buckets over, turn your lanterns low.
There's fire in our heart and fire in our soul,
but there ain't gonna be no fire in the hole.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[You can tell them in the country, tell them in the town,
the miners down in Mingo laid their shovels down.
We won't pull another pillar, load another ton,
or lift another finger until the union we have won ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Daddy died a miner, grandpa he did too.
I'll bet this coal will kill me before my working days are through.
I’m in a hole that’s dark and dirty, an early grave to find,
but I plan to make a union for the ones I leave behind.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Sittin’ high and mighty, they think they’ve got control.
They think they have the power ‘cause they bought up all the coal.
They want us to stand divided, they want for us to fall,
But we plan to stick together to make victory for all.]]></verse>
