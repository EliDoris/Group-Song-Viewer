<chorus><![CDATA[He ougth've been an admiral a sultan or a king,
and to his praises we should always sing.
Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer.
The Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented
beer beer beer
tiddly beer beer beer.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[A long time ago,
way back in history,
when all there was to drink
was a bloody cup of tea.
Along came a man by the name of Carlie Mops,
and he invented a wonderful drink
and he made it out of hops]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[A ... at the silvery moon and pirates call his well,
is one thing you can be sure of,
is Charlie's beer they sell,
so come on all my lucky lads
when the sun comes up she stops!
Five short seconds to remember Charlie Mops,
1 ... 2 ... 3, 4, 5.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh boil up a barrel of hops,
and stir it around with a stick,
is the kind of lubrication thet make your engine tick.
I drink's it with my breakfast,
my dinner,
and my snacks,
Now it's a bloody steel at four away plus tax.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The pirate likes his silver and gold,
now that we know it's true,
but try to take his beer
and he will bloody wear on you thru.
It's the British Navy gaving to their sailors on the sea,
if it's good enough for the navy
then it's bloody well good enough for me.]]></verse>
