<verse><![CDATA[The fox went out on a chilly night
He prayed for the moon to give him light
For he'd many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o
He'd many a mile to go that night, before he reached the town-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[He ran 'til he came to the farmer's pen
The ducks and the geese were kept therein
He said, a couple of you are gonna grease my chin
Before I leave this town-o, town-o, town-o
Said a couple of you are gonna grease my chin, before I leave this town-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[He grabbed the great goose by the neck
And he threw a duck across his back
And he didn't mind the quack, quack
And the legs all dangling down-o, down-o, down-o
He didn't mind the quack, quack and the legs all dangling down-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The old grey woman jumped out of bed
Out of the window she popped her head
Crying John, John, the great goose is gone
And the fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o
John, John, the great goose is gone and the fox is on the town-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[He ran 'til he came to his nice warm den
And there were the little ones, eight, nine, ten
Sayin Daddy, Daddy, better go back again
For it must be a might fine town-o, town-o, town-o
Daddy, Daddy, go back again for it must be mighty fine town-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The fox and his wife, without any strife
Cut up the goose with a fork and a knife
They never had such a supper in their life
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o, bones-o, bones-o
They never had such a supper in their life
And the little ones chewed on the bones]]></verse>
