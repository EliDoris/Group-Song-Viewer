<chorus><![CDATA[Blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down
Wey hey, blow the man down
Blow him right back into Liverpool town
Gimme some time to blow the man down]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Come all you young fellows who follow the sea (To me!)
(Wey hey, blow the man down)
And pray pay attention and listen to me
(Gimme some time to blow the man down)

I'm a deep water sailor just in from Hong Kong (To me!)
(Wey hey, blow the man down)
If you buy me a drink, then I'll sing you a song
(Gimme some time to blow the man down)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[There's tinkers and tailors and soldiers and all (To me!)
(Wey hey, blow the man down)
They all ship for sailors on board the Black Ball
(Gimme some time to blow the man down)

You'll see those poor devils how they will all scoot
(Wey hey, blow the man down)
Assisted along by the toe of a boot
(Gimme some time to blow the man down)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[It's starboard and larboard on deck they will sprawl (To me!)
(Wey hey, blow the man down)
For kickin' Jack Williams commands the Black Ball
(Gimme some time to blow the man down)

Lay aft now, ya lubbers, lay aft now I say (To me!)
(Wey hey, blow the man down)
I'll none of yer dodges on my ship today
(Gimme some time to blow the man down)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So I'll give you fair warning before we belay (To me!)
(Wey hey, blow the man down)
Don't ever take heed of what chantymen say
(Gimme some time to blow the man down)]]></verse>
