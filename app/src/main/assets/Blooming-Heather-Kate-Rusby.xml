<chorus><![CDATA[Will ye go, Lassie go?
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will ye go, Lassie go?]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh the summertime is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I will build my love a tower
Near yon' pure crystal fountain
And on it I will build
All the flowers of the mountain]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[If my true love she were gone
I would surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather]]></verse>
