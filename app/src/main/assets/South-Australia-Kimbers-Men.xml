<chorus><![CDATA[Haul away your rolling king, heave away, haul away
Haul away, you'll hear me sing, we're bound for South Australia]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[In South Australia I was born, (heave away, haul away)
In South Australia, 'round Cape Horn, (we're bound for South Australia)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[As I walked out one morning fair
'Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I shook her up I shook her down
I shook her all around that town]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[There's just one thing that's on my mind
That's leaving Nancy Blair behind]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[As you wallop round Cape Horn
You'll wish to God you've never been born]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[As I land on Australia sand 
A bottle of whiskey in me hand]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[It's back again to Liverpool
To spend me pay like a bloody fool]]></verse>
