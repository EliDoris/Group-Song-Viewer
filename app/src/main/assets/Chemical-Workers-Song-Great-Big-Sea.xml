<chorus><![CDATA[And it's go boys go
They'll time your every breath
And every day you're in this place
You're two days nearer death
But you go]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Well a process man am I
And I'm tellin' you no lie
I work and breathe among the fumes
That trail across the sky
There's thunder all around me
And there's poison in the air
There's a lousy smell
That smacks of hell
And dust all in me hair
]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well I've worked among the spitters
And I breathe the oily smoke
I've shoveled up the gypsum
And it nigh on makes you choke
I've stood knee-deep in cyanide
Got sick with a caustic burn
Been working rough
I've seen enough
To make your stomach turn]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[There's overtime and bonus opportunities galore
The young men like their money
And they all come back for more
But soon you're knocking on
And you look older than you should
For every bob
Made on the job
You pay with flesh and blood]]></verse>
