<chorus><![CDATA[I'm a Newfoundlander born and bred
And I'll be one 'til I die
I'm proud to be an Islander
And here's the reason why
I'm free as the wind
And the waves that wash the sand
There's no place I would rather be
Then here in Newfoundland]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[I spent some time in New York state
And I nearly lost my mind
The city life's too fast for me
Nobody has the time
Cement and steel and flashing lights is all that I could see
It may be good for New York state
But it's no damn good for me]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[In Montreal the frenchmen say that they own Labrador
Including Indian Harbor where me father fished before
But if they wanna fight for her
I'll surley take a stand
And they'll regret the day they tried to take our Newfoundland]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now that the oil is on our shore
We better take the time
To develop it more carefully
Or else we're gonna find
What could have been the answer to a poor economy
It changed our way of living
And destroyed our fishery]]></verse>
