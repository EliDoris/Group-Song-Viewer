<verse><![CDATA[Workin' on a laptop, close to the end
Of a job I've been doin' since half past ten
I don't believe that it's frozen again
The system has gone down-o, down-o, down-o
I don't believe that it's frozen again, the system has gone down-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So I took it down to the help desk guy
I said, "Make it better, or I'm gonna cry"
He said, "I'm sorry, your computer has died
The data can no longer be found-o, found-o, found-o"
He said, "I'm sorry, your computer has died, the data can no longer be found-o"]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[To the roof with the laptop I did go
Over to the edge and I gave it a throw
And when it arrived seven stories below
It really made a mighty fine sound-o, sound-o, sound-o
When it arrived seven stories below, it really made a mighty fine sound-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well, that didn't do enough to ease my pain
So I went down to Dulles and I got on a plane
Sayin', "This is all Billy Gates's fault
I'm gonna be trackin' him down-o, down-o, down-o
This is all Billy Gates's fault, I'm gonna be trackin' him down-o"]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Touched down in Seattle and got off the plane
Hit Starbucks to get out of the rain
Paid all o' my dough for a thimble o' joe
Full o' foam and the cinnamon brown-o, brown-o, brown-o
All o' my dough for a thimble o' joe full o' foam and the cinnamon brown-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When the Gates found out about my plan
He packed up a bag, turned tail and ran
Megalo-man took it out on the lam
And hid way underground-o, ground-o, ground-o
Megalo-man took it out on the lam and hid way underground-o]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well, the Gates been a'runnin' ever since that day
Thinks he can hide but he can't get away
When I finally find his little skinny behind
Gonna kick it all over this town-o, town-o, town-o
Finally find his little skinny behind, gonna kick it all over this town]]></verse>
