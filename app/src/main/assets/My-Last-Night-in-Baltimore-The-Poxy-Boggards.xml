<chorus><![CDATA[Oh Mother, don't wake me, don't jostle or shake me
I spent all night drinking with the ladies by the shore
And if I never wake
Don't cry and don't shriek
Just sing the glorious tales of my last night in Baltimore]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[We were fresh from the sea
Our pockets full of money
When me and me maties
We headed for the bar
No sooner had we arrived
Then 1 pint turned to 5
And a lassie grabbed me by the belt and dragged me towards the stairs]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[There were redheads there were blondes
Brunettes of which i'm fond
We'd ply them with cheap alcohol so they wouldn't leave our side
Before the night was through
We each had one or 2
And by midnight our young cabin boy had found himself a bride]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[We drank 15 kegs of beer
Whiskeys from far and near
We ate up all their venison
We took down all their stew
And when we were run dry
We would not just stand by
A raiding party went next door to liberate more brew]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[teThings started to go queer
When Pat stole Kelly's beer. So he put his fist into Pat's face and started up a fight
Well, the brawl raged all aroun'
And we tore that tavern down
But we rescued all the kegs so we could drink all through the night!mp]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now me head is sore and achy
Me bones are bruised and creaky
And I don't truly expect that I should live to see the light
So tell me girl in Leicester
'till she dies I'll miss her
But in the morning if I'm living, I'll be back tomorrow night!]]></verse>
