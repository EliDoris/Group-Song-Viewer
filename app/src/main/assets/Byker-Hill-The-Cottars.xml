I would have another gill
I would make the piper play
The bonny lass of Byker Hill]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The pitman and the keelman trim
They drink bumble made from gin
Then to dance they do begin
To the tune of Elsie Marley]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When first I went down to the dirt
I had no cowl nor no pitshirt
Now I've gotten two or three
Walker Pit's done well by me]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Geordie Charlton, he had a pig
You hit it with a shovel and it danced a jig
All the way to Walker Shore
To the tune of Elsie Marley]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[If I had another penny
I would have another gill
I would make the piper play
The bonny lass of Byker Hill]]></verse>
