<chorus><![CDATA[So bring us a barrel and set it up right
Bring us a barrel to last out the night
Bring us a barrel no matter how high
We'll drink it up lads we'll drink it dry]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[A man, when he's drinking takes ale from a bin
But finds there too little good stuff there within
Four and a half is it's measure in full
Too small for a sup, not enough for a pull]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The poor little Firkin, nine gallons in all
The ale it is good but the size is too small
For lads who are drinkers like you, and like I
That Firkin small barrel too swiftly runs dry]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So roll out the Puncheon and bring out the Butt
There's a best measure before us to put
Our cups will go round and good ale it will flow
And we'll be content, for an hour or so]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The fullcup and Toss pot and
Headdy go down
The Hoggshead and Firkin and Cask will go round
The Tun and the Barrel and someday there'll be
Enough good brown ale to fill up the sea]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When drinking good ale it is best by the Tun
But never enough can be had in just one
So pray all you drinkers who often run dry
GOD willing our ale it will fall from the sky]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When I am dieing and on my deaths bed
Lay by my bed side a fine full Hoggshead
Swift down below I must go when I die
Then me and Old Nick, we can both drink it dry!]]></verse>
