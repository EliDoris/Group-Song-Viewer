<verse><![CDATA[What will we do when we have no money?
Oh true lovers what will we do then?
Only hawk through the town for a hungry crown,
And we’ll yodel it over again.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And what will we do if we marry a sailor?
Oh true lovers what will we do then?
Only sail on his ships and we’ll play on his lips,
And we’ll yodel it over again.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And what will we do if we marry a soldier?
Oh true lovers what will we do then?
Only handle his gun and we’ll fight for the fun,
And we’ll yodel it over again.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And what will we do if we marry a tinker?
Oh true lovers what will we do then?
Only mend a tin can and walk on with me man,
And we’ll yodel it over again.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And what will we do if we have a young daughter?
Oh true lovers what will we do then?
Only throw her on our back and walk on for the craic,
And we’ll yodel it over again.]]></verse>
