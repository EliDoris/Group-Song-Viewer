<chorus><![CDATA[Why, boozing, bloody well boozing:
Boozing, boozing, just you and I
Boozing, boozing, when we are dry.
Some do it openly, some on the sly
But we all are bloody well boozing.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Now what are the joys of a single young man?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing
And what is he doing whenever he can?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing
You may think I'm wrong or you may think I'm right
I'm not going to argue, I know you can fight
But what do you think we are doing tonight?]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And what are the joys of a poor married man?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing
And what is he doing whenever he can?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing
He comes home at night and he gives his wife all
He goes out a-shopping, makes many a call
But what brings him home hanging on to the wall?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing:]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And what does the Salvation Army run down?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing
And what are they banning in every town?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing
The stand on street corners, they rave and they shout
They shout about things they know nothing about
But what are they doing when the lights are turned out?
Why, boozing, bloody well boozing:]]></verse>
