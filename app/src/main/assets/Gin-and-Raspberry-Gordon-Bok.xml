<chorus><![CDATA[Oh but it's hard, cruel and cold
Searching Cardrona for nuggets of gold
An ounce to the bucket and we'll all sell our souls
For a taste of the Gin and Raspberry]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[While hunting for Fox, we first came this way
From Lake Pembroke township took many long day
To cut through the bush and we found a new rush
With a mine called the Gin and Raspberry]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The rumours went out and the thousands poured in
A handful grew rich and many grew thin
They all hoped to find their own patch of tin
As rich as the Gin and Raspberry  ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[At first it was summer, and we all thought it grand
No shirts on our backs as we sluiced and we panned
But then came the snow and the southern winds blow
And there's ice in the Gin and Raspberry]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[(Young) Billy McGrath, he worked hard and worked long
(Always) ready to smile and to sing us a song
But then he struck gold and was found dead and cold
Down in the Gin and Raspberry]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So I'll work out my time and I'll stay out of strife
I'll save all me tin to send home to me wife 
And when the job's done, I'll leave at the run
And to hell with the Gin and Raspberry.]]></verse>
