<chorus><![CDATA[Oh wouldn't you like to have a pint of beer?
Life is full of pain and misery
Oh wouldn't you like to have a pint of beer?
We'll raise a proper toast and keep you company]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[I went to work today
A whistlin' on my way
When I found out that I'd been given the slip

There was nothing left to say
So I took my last pay
And went to Kelly's pub to have meself a little nip]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The temperance they came round
A marching cross the town
Cryin out against the demon gin
Their faces scowled and frowned but donation of a pound
Buys a trip to Kelly's pub where we can down our sin]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I took miss Nancy Bo
Out to see a show
Where she met a man who played trombone
And then that randy louse put his long thing in and out
And now I sit in Kelly's pub a drinking all alone]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[My grandfather he died
At the height of his manly pride
Astride a dopty lass of twenty one
As the family wailed and cried
Me father took me aside
And said let's go to Kelly's pub and toast his stamina]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So if you're flat and broke
And your gal's with another bloke
And you don't have a clue what you should do
I've got a proven cure
That's simple, fast, and pure
Just go to Kelly's pub with us and sob with someone new]]></verse>
