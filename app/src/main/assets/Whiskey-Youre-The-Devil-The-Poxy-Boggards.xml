<chorus><![CDATA[Whiskey, you're the devil, you're leadin' me astray
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay
You're sweeter, kinder, decenter, you're spunkier than tea
O whiskey, you're my darlin' drunk or sober]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[So now brave boys, we're on the marchin
Off to Portugal and Spain
Drums are beating, banners flying 
The Devil at home will come tonight
Oh love, fare thee well
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o
There's whisky in the jar]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The French are fighting boldly
Men are dying hot and coldly
Give every man his flask of powder
His firelock on his shoulder
Oh love, fare thee well
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o
There's whisky in the jar]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Says the mother do not wrong me
Don't take me daughter from me
For if you do I will torment you
When I'm dead my ghost will haunt you
Love, fare thee well
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o
There's whisky in the jar]]></verse>
