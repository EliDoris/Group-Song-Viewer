Walk him along, John, Carry him along
On every inch we'll carve his name
Carry him to his bury'n ground]]></verse>

Walk him along, John, Carry him along
He's gone where the stormy winds won't blow
Carry him to his bury'n ground]]></verse>

Walk him along, John, Carry him along
Well General Taylor he's long dead and gone
Carry him to his bury'n ground]]></verse>
