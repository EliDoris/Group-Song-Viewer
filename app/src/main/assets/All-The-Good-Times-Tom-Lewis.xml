All the good times are past and gone, little darling don't you weep no more.

    <verse><![CDATA[Singer has left his song on the air, 
Hunter has hung up his horn, 
After the day the long, long nightâ€” 
After the night the dawn.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[I don't want a seat at your table so bright, 
I don't want a bed on your floor, 
You can't hunt me down through the forests of love 
and nail up my hide on your door.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Forget all the teeth that threaten to tear, 
forget all the pains in your head, 
The meek and the weak shall inherit the earth, 
the savage and honest are dead.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Build me a boat where the willows once grew, 
where the vole and the otter swam free, 
Row me away from this desolate land, 
make for the open sea.]]></verse>
