<chorus><![CDATA[Leave her Johnny, leave her
Oh leave her Johnny, leave her
For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh I thought I heard the old man say
(Leave her Johnny, leave her)
Oh it's time to come and get your pay
(And it's time for us to leave her)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now the wind blew hard and the sea rose high
Oh she shipped it green and none went by]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[It's mahogany beef and it's weevils in your bread
oh I wish old cracker hash Joe was dead]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now the maid is a bucker and the captain is a Turk
and the bosun is a bastard with the middle name of work]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh she's Paris bound and she's Paris rigged
and the whole damn crew is fever-stricked]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now the rats have gone and we the crew
Oh it's time by Christ that we went too]]></verse>
