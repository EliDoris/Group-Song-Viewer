<chorus><![CDATA[One two three four five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, Whack fol lol le rah!]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[In the merry month of June from my home I started
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted Father dear, kissed my darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins a
Brand new pair of brogues, rattlin' o'er the bogs
Frightenin' all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
Started by daylight my spirits bright and airy
Took a drop of the pure
Keep my heart from sinking;
That's the Paddy's cure whenever he's on for drinking
To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
An' asked if I was hired, wages I required
'Till I was nearly tired of the rocky road to Dublin]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city
Well then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality
Something crossed my mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon my stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, said my Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[From there I got away, me spirits never failing
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead wished meself was dead
Or better far instead
On the rocky road to Dublin]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's isle they began abusing
"Hurrah me soul!" says I, me shillelagh I let fly
Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in
With a loud "Hurray!" joined in the affray
We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin]]></verse>
