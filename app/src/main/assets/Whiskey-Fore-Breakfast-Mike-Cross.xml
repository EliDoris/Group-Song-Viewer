<chorus><![CDATA[Lord preserve us and protect us,
We been drinkin' whiskey 'fore breakfast!]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Well early one day the sun wouldn't shine
I was walkin' down the street not feelin' too fine
I saw two old men with a bottle between 'em
This is the song I heard them singin':]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well I stopped by the steps
where they were sittin'
And I couldn't believe
how drunk they were gettin'
I said "Old men, ya been drinking long?"
They said "Long enough
to start singin' this song":]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[They passed me the bottle
Said "Take a little sip"
And it felt so good that I just couldn't quit
So I drank a little more, next thing I knew
There were 3 of us sittin' there singin' this tune:]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well one by one everybody in the town
Heard our ruckus and they all came down
And pretty soon all the streets were ringin'
With the sound of the whole town
laughin' and singin':]]></verse>
</song>
