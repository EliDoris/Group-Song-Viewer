Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
Gonna take another stroll down town]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I take a fool notion
To jump in the river and drown]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Stop rambling, stop your gambling
Stop staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
And stay by the fire side bright]]></verse>
