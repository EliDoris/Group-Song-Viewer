<chorus><![CDATA[I'd rather have lager than life
I'll take a strong stout over strife
I'd prefer to confer with a half-pint of ale
Than live a long life till my private parts fail
For life without liquor is to no avail
So bring me lager for life]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[I'd rather have whiskey than wealth
For riches bring thieves of great stealth
The wealthy drink wine and on pheasant they dine
But give me a keg and a fine turkey leg
And I'll eat, drink and toast to your health]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I'd rather have beer than have fame
For drinking's a much safer game
Though bravery's a virtue, that warfare can hurt you
Let other men fight while I drink every night
And gain a less sober acclaim]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I'll take good ale over girls
They titter and play with their curls
Young women complain and cause me great pain
But with Ale as my mate, I'll thank God for my fate
While I give her a necklace of pearls]]></verse>
