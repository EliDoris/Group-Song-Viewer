<chorus><![CDATA[Wrap me up in me oilskin and jumper 
No more on the docks I'll be seen 
Just tell me old shipmates 
I'm taking a trip, mates 
And I'll see you one day in Fiddler's Green ]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[As I went by the dockside one evening so fair 
To view the still water and take the salt air 
I heard an old fisherman singing this song 
Won't you take me away boys my time is not long ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell 
Where fishermen go when they don't go to Hell 
Where the skies are all clear and the dolphins do play 
And the cold coast of Greenland is far, far away ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Where there's always a breeze and there's never a gale 
And the fish jump on board with a swish in their tail 
and you lie at your leisure, there's nothing to do 
And the captain's below making tea for the crew ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[when you get to the dock and the long trip is through
There's pubs and there's clubs, and there's lassies there too 
and the girls are all pretty and the beer it is free 
And there's bottles of rum growing from every tree ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I don't need a harp or a halo, not me 
Just give me a breeze and a stiff rolling sea 
And I'll play me old squeeze box as we roll along 
When the wind in the rigging will sing me this song]]></verse>
