    <chorus><![CDATA[Oh lover I'll see you there
waiting in the willows with your autumn hair
Oh lover I'll see you there
after many miles.]]></chorus>
    <verse><![CDATA[I'll bring you flowers
when you're dead and gone.
Asleep in the pines
in the valley of the mountain.
Next to you I'll lay my bones
when I've reached my prime,
beside the brandywine where I finally find my rest.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[I swear I've known you from another time
And I caught you down the line
but I couldn't stop you moving.
And when I found you by the riverside
It's waters wild and wide
you left me again.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[An echo of an echo
It's a semblence of a sound
and I've prayed and I've waited
with my ear upon the ground.
But the shovel it digs deep
and the calluses grow over.
Like a mirror to a mirror
the canyons call your name.]]></verse>
