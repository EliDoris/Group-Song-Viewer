<verse><![CDATA[The stars above in Heaven are looking kindly down
The stars above in Heaven are looking kindly down
The stars above in Heaven are looking kindly down
On the grave of old John Brown]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[He captured Harper's Ferry with his nineteen men so true
He frightened old Virginia till she trembled through and through
They hung him for a traitor, they themselves the traitor crew
But his soul goes marching on]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well he's gone to be a soldier in the army of the lord
He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the lord
He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the lord
But his sould goes marching on]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord
He is stamping out sedition where the grapes of wrath are stored
He has loosed the faithful lightning of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on]]></verse>
