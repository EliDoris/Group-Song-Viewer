<chorus><![CDATA[Let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
Through the streets in my kilt I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald where's your trousers]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[I've just come down from the isle of Skye
I'm no very big an' I'm awfully shy
The lassies say as I go by
Donald where's your trousers]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now I went to a fancy ball
And it was slippery in the hall
And I was feared that I might fall
For I hadnae on me trousers]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now I went down to London town
To have a little fun on the underground
The ladies turn their heads around
Saying "Donald where are your trousers"]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[The lassies love me every one
But let them catch me if they can
You cannae take the breeks off a Hielan' man
Donald where's your trousers]]></verse>
