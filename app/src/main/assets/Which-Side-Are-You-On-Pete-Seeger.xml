<verse><![CDATA[Come all you good workers,
Good news to you I'll tell
Of how the good old union
Has come in here to dwell.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[My dady was a miner,
And I'm a miner's son,
He'll be with you fellow workers
Until this battle's won.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[They say in Harlan County
There are no neutrals there.
You'll either be a union man
Or a thug for J. H. Blair.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh workers can you stand it?
Oh tell me how you can?
Will you be a lousy scab
Or will you be a man?]]></verse>
