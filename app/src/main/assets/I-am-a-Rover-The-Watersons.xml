<chorus><![CDATA[I am a rover, and that's well known:
I am a-bound for to leave my home;
Leaving my friends and my dear to mourn;
My bonny lass, till I return.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[She drew a chair, and bade me sit down,
And soon she'd told me her heart I'd won:
She turned her head when I took my leave -
Farewell my lass, for me don't grieve.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh, am I bound or am I free?
Oh, am I bound for to marry thee?
A married life you soon shall see,
A contented mind's no jealousy.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I sat me down for to write a song,
I wrote it wide and I wrote it long,
At every line I cried "My dear"
At every word, I shed a tear.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[As I rode over yon dreary moor,
Ere I lost sight of my true love's door,
My legs were lame and my eyes were blind -
I'd left my bonny lass behind.]]></verse>
