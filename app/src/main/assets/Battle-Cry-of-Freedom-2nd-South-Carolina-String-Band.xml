<chorus><![CDATA[The Union forever, Hurrah! boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitors,
And up with the stars;
While we rally round the flag, boys,
Rally once again, Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh, we'll rally round the flag, boys,
We'll rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom,
We will rally from the hillside,
We'll gather from the plain,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[
We are springing to the call
Of our brothers gone before,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom;
And we'll fill our vacant ranks with
A million free men more,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[We will welcome to our numbers
The loyal, true and brave,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom;
And although they may be poor,
Not a man shall be a slave,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So we're springing to the call
From the East and from the West,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom;
And we'll hurl the rebel crew
From the land that we love best,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.]]></verse>
