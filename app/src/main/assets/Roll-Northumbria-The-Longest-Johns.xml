<chorus><![CDATA[And it's one for the hot sun above
Two for the empire we love
And it's three for the fire that burns down below
Roll on Northumbria
Roll, Northumbria, Roll]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA['Twas late 65 at the old wall sea yard
She was commissioned to haul the black tar
And built the Northumbria there on the bar
Roll, Northumbria, Roll

For when the Egyptians they closed the Red Sea
And call came on high from the powers that be
To build a royal monster right down on the key
Roll, Northumbria, Roll, me boys
Roll, Northumbria, Roll]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Carpathia, Vengeance, celestial call
She was the tanker to out-size them all
From the banks of the Merci to the port of the Laul
Roll, Northumbria, Roll

And fair Princess Anne threw a bottle of wine
And watch as the giants set down in the Tyne
What lay ahead could no mortal divine
Roll, Northumbria, Roll, me boys
Roll, Northumbria, Roll]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So come all ya good workmen, beware the command
That comes down on high from the desk of a man
Who's never held steel or torch in his hands
Roll, Northumbria, Roll

For atop a wild breaker, the cracks in her frame
Spilled her black guts all across the wild Maine
And she limped away through an ocean of flame
Roll, Northumbria, Roll, me boys
Roll, Northumbria, Roll]]></verse>
