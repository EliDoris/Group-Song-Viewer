<chorus><![CDATA[I'll fathom the bowl, I'll fathom the bowl,
Give me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Come all you bold heroes, give an ear to me song;
I will sing in the praise of good brandy and rum:
There's a clear crystal fountain near England shall roll.
Give me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[From France we do get brandy, from Jamaica comes rum;
Sweet oranges and apples from Portugal come.
But stout and strong cider are England's control.
Give me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[My wife she do disturb me when I'm laid at my ease,
For she does as she likes and she says as she please.
My wife she's a devil, she's black as the coal.
Give me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[My father he do lie in the depths of the sea
With no stone at his head by, what matters for he?
There's a clear crystal fountain near England shall roll.
Give me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl]]></verse>
