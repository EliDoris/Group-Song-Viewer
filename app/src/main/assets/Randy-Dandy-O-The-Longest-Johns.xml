<chorus><![CDATA[Heave a pawl, O heave away
Way, hay, roll an' go!
The anchor's on board an' the cable's all stored
To be rollicking randy dandy-O!]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Now we are ready to head for the Horn
Way, hay, roll an' go!
Our boots an' our clothes boys are all in the pawn
To be rollicking randy dandy-O!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Man the stout caps'n an' heave with a will
Way, hay, roll an' go!
Soon we'll be drivin' her 'way down the hill
To be rollicking randy dandy-O!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Soon we'll be warping her out through the locks
Way, hay, roll an' go!
Where the pretty young gals all come down in their flocks
To be rollicking randy dandy-O!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[
We're outward bound for Vallipo Bay
Way, hay, roll an' go!
Get crackin', m' lads, 'tis a hell o' a way!
To be rollicking randy dandy-O!]]></verse>
