<chorus><![CDATA[With yer guns and rum, and rum and guns
Hurroo, Hurroo
With yer guns and rum, and rum and guns
Hurroo, Hurroo
With yer guns and rum, and rum and guns
The enemy nearly slew ya, Oh Johnny boy you'll be destroyed
Johnny I hardly knew ya]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[We boarded the ship most eagerly
Hurroo, Hurroo
Drinking and carousing merrily
Hurroo, Hurroo
For we all knew where the ship had been, sailing for gold and back again.
We were more like a kennel of hounds than men.
Johnny I hardly knew ya]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When it rained on our first night at sea
Hurroo, Hurroo
Blacking out the kings navy
Hurroo, Hurroo
Yonder vessel the boatswain cried, our galleon hitting their ship broadside
And our thirst for blood did coincide
Johnny I hardly knew ya]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[His efforts they were all for naught
Harroo, Harroo
They took his arm with a cannon shot
Harroo, Harroo
A stab in the eye, a slice in the gut, and ended it all with a kick in the butt
They let Johnny know just what was what
Johnny I hardly knew ya]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[When we returned to our port city
Harroo, Harroo
Twenty sea rogues in absentee
Harroo, Harroo
Then on the road in sweet Athy, a stick in the hand, a drop in the eye
A doleful damsel I heard cry
Johnny I hardly knew ya]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Where are the legs with which you run
Harroo, Harroo
The enemy came and left me none
Harroo, Harroo
Where are the legs with which you run, when first you went to carry a gun
Oh Johnny your dancing days are done, and
Johnny I hardly knew ya]]></verse>
