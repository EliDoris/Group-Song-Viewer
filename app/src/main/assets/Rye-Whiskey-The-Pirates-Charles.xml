<chorus><![CDATA[I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry,
If the hard times don't kill me, I'll lay down and die
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey I cry
If you don't give me rye whiskey I surely will die]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[I'll tune up my fiddle and rosin my bow
I make myself welcome, wherever I go
Beefsteak when I'm hungry, red booze when I'm dry
Dubloons when I'm hard up and religion when I die

They say I drink whiskey, my money's my own
And them that don't like me, can leave me alone
Sometimes I drink whiskey, sometimes I drink rum
Sometimes I drink brown ale and other times none]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[But if I get boozey, my whiskey's my own
And them that don't like me, can leave me alone
Jack o' Diamonds, Jack o' Daniel's I know you of old
You've robbed me poor pockets of silver and gold

Oh whiskey, you villain, you've been my downfall
You've kicked me, you've cuffed me, but I love you for all
If the ocean were whiskey and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom and drown to get drunk]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[My foot in a stirrup, her scarf in my hand
I pray thee sweet Lillie, she'll find a good man
Her parents don't like me, they say I'm too poor
Unfit and unworthy to enter her door

Sweet milk when I'm hungry, rye whiskey when dry
If a tree don't fall on me, I'll live 'till I die
I'll buy my own whiskey and make my own stew
And when I get drunk all, it's because of you]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I'll drink my own whiskey and finish your wine
Some ten thousand bottles I've killed in my time
I've no wife to quarrel, no babies to bawl
The best way of livin's with no wife at all

On Mullacor Mountain I wander alone
I'm drunk as the devil, oh, leave me alone
You may boast of your wisdom and brag of your blood
We'll both be forgotten in the wake of the flood]]></verse>
