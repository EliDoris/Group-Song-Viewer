<chorus><![CDATA[Cause it's a heave-ho! hi-ho!
Coming down the plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey! hi-hey!
Farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
Arr!]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh, I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine
I had a little stretch of land along the CP line
But times were hard and though I tried, the money wasn't there
And bankers came and took my land and told me fair is fair
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always "no"
Hire you now, they'd always laugh, we just let twenty go!
The government, they promised me a measly little sum
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum

Then I thought who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone
I'm gonna be a PIRATE! on the River Saskatchewan!
(arr! arr! arr!)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well you think the locals farmers would know that I'm at large
But, just the other day I saw an unprotected barge
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser
I rammed their ship, and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer!
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river
The farmers pass in so much fear, their stomachs are a-quiver
Because the know that TRACTOR JACK! is waiting in the bay
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well Mountie Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat
He'd follow on the shoreline because he didn't own a boat
But cutbacks were a-coming and the Mountie lost his job
Now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob
A swingin' sword, and skull n' bones, and pleasant company
I never pay my income tax and screw the GST â€” SCREW IT!
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon, I'm the terror of the sea
If ya wanna reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well, pirate life's appealing, but you don't just find it here
I've heard that in Alberta, there's a band of buccaneers
They roam the Athabasca, from Smith to Fort McKay
And you're gonna lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way
Well winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze
Our pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze
I'll be back in springtime, but now I've to go
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico!]]></verse>
