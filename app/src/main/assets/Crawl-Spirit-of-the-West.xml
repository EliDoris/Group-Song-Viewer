<chorus><![CDATA[Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[It all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside
We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;
When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall
So we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[We planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare
We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;
I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five
From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share
Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;
The beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry
So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross
We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;
For you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove
So there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call
The final destination of this the first annual crawl;
We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found
Nine miles home and for walking we are bound]]></verse>
