<chorus><![CDATA[Heel ya ho, boys! Let her go, boys!
Bring her head round into the weather!
Heel ya ho, boys! Let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay!]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[What care we how white the Minch is?
What care we for the wind and weather?
Let her go, boys, every inch is
Sailing homeward to Mingulay!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Wives are waitin' by the pier head
Or looking seaward (oh) from the heather
Bring her head 'round, then you'll anchor
Ere the sun sets on Mingulay!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Sun comes low now by the yard, boys
Right the clouds are to the westward
Songs of home fly in the wind, boys
Flyin' homeward to Mingulay!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Ships return now, heavy-laden
Mothers holdin' their bairns a-cryin'
We'll return, though, ere the sun sets
We'll return to Mingulay!]]></verse>
</song>
