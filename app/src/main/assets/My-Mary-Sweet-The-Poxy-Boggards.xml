<chorus><![CDATA[To see her in the pale moonlight
To hear her sing was my delight
To watch her dance on angel's feet
To hear the voice of my Mary sweet]]></chorus>
<chorus><![CDATA[To see him in the pale moonlight
To hear him sing was my delight
To watch him dance on angel's feet
To hear the voice of my Larry sweet]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[When I first saw her, she walked alone
I followed her till she came to her home
She gave me a smile, our eyes, they did meet
And I fell in love with my Mary sweet]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Her hair was silk and her eyes, they did shine
And I so wished that she would be mine
Her smile was bright, her eyes, they did greet
Each time that I saw me Mary sweet]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I asked if she'd have so humble a lad
Said she, no finer a man could be had
And so we did marry, sweet Mary and me
Our lives were joined forever to be]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I carried her over the threshold with care
We lay on the bed and I stroked her hair
I reached for her nethers, but found I'd been had
Me Mary was Larry, this lass was a lad]]></verse>
