<verse><![CDATA[Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear ya
(Away, you rolling river)
Oh Shenandoah, I can't get near ya
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh Shenandoah, I took a notion
(Away, you rolling river)
To sail across that stormy ocean
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave ya
(Away, you rolling river)
But in my dreams I'm bound to hear ya
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[For seven long years I caught a nancy
(Away, you rolling river)
For seven long years she took me fancy
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And then she went to Kansas City
(Away, you rolling river)
So far away to Kansas City
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[And there she had her shush-shush baby
(Away, you rolling river)
Oh there she had that shush-shush baby
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I guess she's got another lover
(Away, you rolling river)
I've a-heard she's lodgin' with a soldier
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Farewell, my dear, I'm bound to leave ya
(Away, you rolling river)
I'm bound away and I won't deceive ya
(Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri)]]></verse>
