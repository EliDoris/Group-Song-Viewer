<chorus><![CDATA[What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
Ear-lie in the morning
Hoo-ray and up she rises (Hoo-ray)
Hoo-ray and up she rises (Hoo-ray)
Hoo-ray and up she rises (Hoo-ray)
Ear-lie in the morning]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[From Tortuga's port we put to sea
And sailed for sixteen days
In the biggest storm I'd ever seen
We almost lost our way
When a call came from a deckhand
“Boys, I think she’s going down
But don’t you fear
There’s enough rum here
To drink until we drown!”]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[So this deckhand grabbed a barrel
Broke the seal and took a swig
And soon their screams turned into songs
Their panicked work turned into jigs
The first mate bellowed orders
Ever trying to save their skins
“Any drunken retch
The captain catch
He’ll beat all limb from limb!”]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Every man continued drinking
All their duties long forgot
They were deaf to every order
‘Til they heard a pistol shot
The captain stood on fo'c'stle
Swung the cat above his head
“Back to yer post
Or by my ghost
Ye’ll wish that ye were dead!”]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Every drunk received a beating
Some of the drunker managed two
The captain kept an eye
Until he’d sobered up his crew
He then retired to quarters
Put the rum upon his shelf
Sat in his seat
Put up his feet
And drank the rest himself!]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Put him in the longboat ‘til he’s sober
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Throw him in the hold with the captain’s daughter
Ear-lie in the mourning s]]></verse>
