    <chorus> Soon may the Wellerman come 
    And bring us sugar and tea and rum.
    One day, when the tonguin’ is done, 
    We’ll take our leave and go. </chorus>
    <verse>There once was a ship that put to sea,
        The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
        The winds blew up, her bow dipped down,
        O blow, my bully boys, blow.</verse>
    <verse>She had not been two weeks from shore
        When down on her a right whale bore.
        The captain called all hands and swore
        He’d take that whale in tow.</verse>
    <verse>Before the boat had hit the water
        The whale’s tail came up and caught her.
        All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
        When she dived down below.</verse>
    <verse>No line was cut, no whale was freed;
        The Captain’s mind was not of greed,
        But he belonged to the whaleman’s creed;
        She took the ship in tow.</verse>
    <verse>For forty days, or even more,
        The line went slack, then tight once more.
        All boats were lost (there were only four)
        But still the whale did go.</verse>
    <verse>As far as I know, the fight’s still on;
        The line’s not cut and the whale’s not gone.
        The Wellerman makes his regular call
        To the Captain, crew, and all.</verse>
