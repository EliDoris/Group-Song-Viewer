    <chorus><![CDATA[Soon may the Wellerman come
And bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
We’ll take our leave and go. ]]></chorus>
    <verse><![CDATA[There once was a ship that put to sea,
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down,
O blow, my bully boys, blow.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore.
The captain called all hands and swore
He’d take that whale in tow.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Before the boat had hit the water
The whale’s tail came up and caught her.
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[No line was cut, no whale was freed;
The Captain’s mind was not of greed,
But he belonged to the whaleman’s creed;
She took the ship in tow.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[For forty days, or even more,
The line went slack, then tight once more.
All boats were lost (there were only four)
But still the whale did go.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[As far as I know, the fight’s still on;
The line’s not cut and the whale’s not gone.
The Wellerman makes his regular call
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all.]]></verse>
