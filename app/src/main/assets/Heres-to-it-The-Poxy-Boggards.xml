<chorus><![CDATA[Here's to a long life and a merry one
Here's to a quick death and an easy one
Here's to a pretty girl and an honest one
Here's to a cold pint and another one]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[May you always have walls for the wind
A roof for the rain and tea beside the fire
Laughter to cheer you and those you love near you
And all your heart may desire]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[May the sun shine all day long
Everything go right and nothing go wrong
May those who you love bring love back to you
And may all your wishes come true]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[May be your pockets be heavy and your heart be light
May good luck follow you morning and night
May pretty girls follow you to your door
May you never want for more ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[May you have love that never ends
Lots of money, and lots of friends
Health be yours whatever you do
Lift the cup as we drink to you]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Here's to a woman's kisses
And to irish whiskey, amber and beer
Not as sweet as the kiss of the miss
But a damn side?? more sincere]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now I have known quite a many
And liked more than a few
But I have loved only one my dear
And this toast is to you]]></verse>
