    <chorus><![CDATA[Shovel the snow lads, seven feet tall. Hooves a pounding clear and haul.
Clear and haul lads, clear and haul. Hooves a pounding, clear and haul]]></chorus>
    <chorus><![CDATA[Pull the oars lads seven feet tall, waves a pounding heave and haul
Heave and haul lads heave and haul, waves a pounding heave and haul]]></chorus>
    <verse><![CDATA[Captain Gibson hear our plea.
Six mens lives are in peril at sea.
Send the boats oh send the boats.
The Whitby visitor is no more.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Coxswain shouted can't you see
We shall never clear that sea
Boats not for sailing, not today
But six men's lives we shall yet save]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Grab the shovels, seas of snow
Through blizzard drift we shall go
O'er the moors lads o'er the moors
At Robin Hood's Bay we'll launch there]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Harness fastened leathers tight
Ne'er anyone had seen such sight
Steady up boys steady up
Mighty beasts haul the load]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Hundreds fight the snow that day
More horses harnessed on the way
Twixt cosy homes with fires aglow
But pounding seas still lay ahead]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Exhausted men can barely stand
But the Robert Whitworth will be manned
Oars all smashed and steering broke
With salty tears they head for shore]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[We'll try again we shall not fail
Eighteen men shall fight the gale
Hours passed men hauled aboard
White horses crashing to the bay]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Such a journey ne'er forget
Inner strength will save men yet
Fight nature's forces for precious life
Lifeboat men to you our praise]]></verse>
