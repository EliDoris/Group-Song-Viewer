<chorus><![CDATA[When they met Kelly's Irish Brigade, me boys.
When they met Kelly's Irish Brigade.
Didn't those cowardly Lincoln-ites tremble
When they met with the Irish brigade?]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Listen all ye that hold communion
With southern Confederates so bold,
And I'll tell you of some men for the Union 
Who In the northern ranks were enrolled;
They came to Missouri in their "glory, " and
thought, at their might, we'd be dismayed;
But they soon had a different story
When they met Kelly's Irish brigade]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[They have called us rebels and traitors,
But themselves have thrown off the name of late.
They were called it by the English invaders
At home in the Eve of ninety-eight (1798)
The name to us is not a new one though,
Tis' one that shall never degrade.
And each blue-hearted Irishman
In the ranks of Kelly's Irish Brigade.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well they dare not call us invaders,
'Tis but state rights and liberties we ask;
And Missouri, we'll ever defend her,
No matter how hard may be the task.
Then let true  Irishmen assemble, let
 the voice of Missouri be obeyed;
And northern fanatics may tremble
When again they meet Kelly's Irish Brigade.]]></verse>
