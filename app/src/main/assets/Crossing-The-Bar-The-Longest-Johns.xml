    <verse><![CDATA[Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar
When I put out to sea.

When I put out to sea, when I put out to sea.
And may there be no moaning of the bar
When I put out to sea.]]></verse>
    <verse><![CDATA[Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness or farewell
When I embark.

When I embark, when I embark,
And may there be no sadness or farewell
When I embark.

    <verse><![CDATA[But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Turns again home, turns again home,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[For though from out our bourne of time and place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.

When I have crossed the bar, when I have crossed the bar.
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar

When I have crossed the bar, when I have crossed the bar.
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar]]></verse>
