<verse><![CDATA[When I was just a little lad, or so me Mammi told me

Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I used to have an Irish girl but she got fat and lazy

But now I've got a Bristol girl and she just drives me crazy
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Oh Louis was the king of France before the Revolut-i-on
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe
Then he got his head chopped off & it spoiled his constitut-i-on
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Ya call yourself a "Second Mate", ya cann'e tie a bowlin'
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe
You cannot even stand up straight when the packet, she's a-rollin'
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well now can't ya see... the black clouds a-gatherin'
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe
Well now can't ya see... the storm clouds a-risin'
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe]]></verse>
