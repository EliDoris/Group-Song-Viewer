<verse><![CDATA[Let grasses grow and waters flow in a free and easy way,
But give me enough of the fine old stuff that's made near Galway Bay,
And Poilcemen all from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim too,

We'll give them the slip and we'll take a sip
Of the rare old Mountain Dew]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still,
Where the smoke curls up to the sky,
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell
That there's poitin brewin' nearby.

It fills the air with all dew rare,
And betwixt both me and you,
When home we stroll, we can take a bowl,
Or a bucket of the Mountain Dew]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now learned men who use the pen,
Have wrote your praises high
The sweet poitin from Ireland green,
Distilled from wheat and rye.

Throw away with your pills, it'll cure all ills,
A Pagan, a Christian, a Jew,
So take off your coat and grease your throat
With a bucket of the Mountain Dew]]></verse>
