I'd a pain in me a** from carrying bricks
With your hammers a nails and shovels an picks
A working on the railway,]]></verse>

With bills of stock and our cravat
And nothing but an old silk hat
We're working on the railway,]]></verse>

Me hands did bristle and me belly did ache
We hired a boat and made a stake
From working on the railway,]]></verse>

The California hills looked prime
We found some gold and left behind
From working on the railway,]]></verse>
