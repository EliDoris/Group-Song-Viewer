<chorus><![CDATA[Fare thee well me boy as you wonder this night 
Be not feared in the darkness my heart is your light 
As you go brave Men of Erin 
Faith and love by your side 
I will dream of your peace in the night ]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Please don’t cry my Mother as you sit by the hearth 
I will dance your memories with joy in my heart 
I will go now and pray as I travel this land 
And live by the lessons you gave ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Please don’t cry my Father as you sit by the hearth 
I will dance your memories with joy in my heart 
I will go now and pray as I travel this land 
And live by the lessons you gave ]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[
Please don’t cry my Children 
As you stand by my Grave 
I have danced your memories all of my days 
I will go now and pray as I travel this land 
And live be the lessons you gave]]></verse>
