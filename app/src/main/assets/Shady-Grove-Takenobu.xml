<chorus><![CDATA[Shady Grove
My little love
Shady Grove, I know
Shady Grove 
My little love
I'm bound for Shady Grove]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Peaches in the summertime
Apples in the fall
If I can't have the girl I love
I don't want none at all]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I wish I had a banjo string
Made of golden twine
And every tune I played on it
I wish that girl was mine]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[I wish I had a needle and thread
The finest that could sew
I'd sew that pretty girl to my side
And down the road I'd go]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Cheeks as red as the bloomin' rose
Eyes of the prettiest brown
She is the darling of my heart
The prettiest girl in town]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Some come here to fiddle and dance
Some come here to tarry
Some come here to fiddle and dance
I came here to marry]]></verse>
