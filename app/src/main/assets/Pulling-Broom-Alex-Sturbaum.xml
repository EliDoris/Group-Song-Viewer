<chorus><![CDATA[And it's one more day
Of the smell of Earth and wood smoke
One more day
Pulling broom]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[It was on one winter morning clear
We loaded up and packed our gear
We went out at the break of day
We was pulling broom up concrete way]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well the scotch broom fields grew thick and wide
River roaring on the other side
Get up buddy no time to sleep
'cause the broom grows high and the roots run deep]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Little Al Collin in the dogford trees
As the grey dawn wakes us from our ease
In the morning sun we roam the road
With a big iron bar and heavy load]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Well the Northwest rain come a-pouring down
So hard you feel like you might drown
So ya bend your backs and you pull together
And you hope like hell for better weather]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Now the burn pile's stacked and the fire's died down
And before too long we'll be homeward bound
Come sundown we'll be on our way
With an aching back and four weeks pay]]></verse>
