<chorus><![CDATA[Picking up coal and we're picking up speed
Shovel as much as the engine needs
Sweat and blood gonna earn my pay
All the way to 'Frisco Bay]]></chorus>
<chorus><![CDATA[Picking up coal and we're picking up speed
Shovel as much as the engine needs
Ain't no slave but we slave away
All the way to 'Frisco Bay]]></chorus>
<chorus><![CDATA[Picking up coal and we're picking up speed
Shovel as much as the engine needs
If I should fall leave me where I lay
On the railway to 'Frisco Bay]]></chorus>
<verse><![CDATA[Give me a spade and I'll give you a hole
(Way-O on the railroad)
Dirt on my brow but steel in my soul
(Way-O on the railroad)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Blowing through hills trying to make up time
(Way-O on the railroad)
Ain't nothing gonna stand in the way of our line
(Way-O on the railroad)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Bossman says that a mile a day's the pace
(Way-O on the railroad)
I'll make two for the look on his face
(Way-O on the railroad)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Surveyor's trying to plan which route is best
(Way-O on the railroad)
Just draw a straight line from East to West
(Way-O on the railroad)]]></verse>
<verse><![CDATA[Spare no quarter and we'll spare no man
(Way-O on the railroad)
Just pray we don't run in to the Cheyenne
(Way-O on the railroad)]]></verse>
